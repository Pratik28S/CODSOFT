My Subject is Java development. 
I just started learning java a few days back and i'm more than a bit late to start working on these I was caught with some unskippable situations and had to deal with them first.
But now i have my entire focus is on this project and i will update my repo on regular intervals as i progress through each and every task of this project.
I'll upload some images of me writing down the ideas i have in my mind of each task as i should have something to prove that all my code is not copied from somwehere.
As far as i know i am allowed to use resources throughout the internet and i'll use some AI modules like chatGpt but just to learn and none of my code is copied. The reason is pretty simple i am new to java that's it.


Tasks chosen : 1. Number Game.
               2. Student Grade Calculator.
               3. Currency Converter.

My First task is completed and have uploaded the file of the same. Also I'll attach my hand written notes that I thought I should apply to the code not everything I wrote is implemented in the code as I started very late on working on this project and wasting my time on only 1 task isn't a good option for me right now but I'll add those features to the code as soon as I complete all the 3 tasks.

Update: 30/08 18:30 
Second task is completed i.e. a student grade calculator displaying the Total marks,Average percentage & Grade.


Update 4/09 10:07 
Final task of currency conversion with api is completed.
