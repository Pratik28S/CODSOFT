My Subject is Java development. 
I just started learning java a few days back and i'm more than a bit late to start working on these I was caught with some unskippable situations and had to deal with them first.
But now i have my entire focus is on this project and i will update my repo on regular intervals as i progress through each and every task of this project.
I'll upload some images of me writing down the ideas i have in my mind of each task as i should have something to prove that all my code is not copied from somwehere.
As far as i know i am allowed to use resources throughout the internet and i'll use some AI modules like chatGpt but just to learn and none of my code is copied. The reason is pretty simple i am new to java that's it.



Tasks chosen : 1. Number Game.
               2. Student Grade Calculator.
               3. Currency Converter.
